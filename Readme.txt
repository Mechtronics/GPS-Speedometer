My car's speedometer always shows higher speed than actual speed. This is my homemade solution to that problem. It takes speed and location from GPS sattelite as well as temperature and humidity from humidity/temp sensor and shows that to a tiny 1.25 inch OLED display. It also shows distance from home, home direction, north direction, GPS time, number of satellite it usages to get fix.
